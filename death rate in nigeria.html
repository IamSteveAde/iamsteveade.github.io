										<p data-aos="zoom-out"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">This insightful dashboard answers most of the loaded questions on the death rates in Nigeria.</p>

										<p data-aos="zoom-out"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">Due to my curious nature, I asked myself these four questions:</p>
										<ul data-aos="zoom-out"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">
											<li>What illness causes the most death in Nigeria?</li>
											<li>Which states were majorly affected in Nigeria?</li>
											<li>What are the death rates per year in the Urban and Rural settlements in Nigeria?</li>
											<li>How many people died or survived a particular illness?</li>
										</ul>
										<p data-aos="zoom-out"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">I decided to carry out an analysis to answer these disturbing questions to create awareness. The dataset I used for this analysis was obtained from kaggle.</p>

										<h2 data-aos="zoom-out"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">What illness causes the most death in Nigeria?</h2>
										<p> data-aos="zoom-out"
											data-aos-duration="900"
											data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart"Diarrhea caused the most deaths from 2009 to 2018, with a total of 14,361 deaths. Ebola caused the least number of death with 14,165 numbers of fatalities compared to other illnesses. However, Ebola was the highest cause of death between 2011 and 2016, with 8,609 numbers of death. This means that, Ebola virus caused a major epidemic between 2011 and 2016.</p>
										<p data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">According to the data, the highest death occurred in 2017, dominated majorly by Malaria in Nigeria, Kano was the central part of Nigeria that was majorly affected by the malaria illness, although awareness was made and the death rate reduced in 2018 from 14,399 deaths to 14,127 deaths.</p>
										<p data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">The lowest death occurred in 2011, with 14,082 deaths. Rubella Mars dominated during this period. Taraba and Adamawa were the states majorly affected by this illness</p>
										<p data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">N.B: Adamawa and Taraba are neighbouring states.</p>
										<h2 data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">Which States were majorly affected in Nigeria?</h2>
										<p data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">Bayelsa and Ondo were the most affected states from 2009 to 2018. 3,970 deaths occurred in the two states, which recorded the highest death amongst all other states. Cross river had the lowest death with 3,743 deaths between 2009 to 2018.</p>
										<h2 data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">What are the death rates per year in the Urban and Rural settlements in Nigeria?</h2>
										<p data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">The rural settlement had more deaths than the urban settlement between 2009 and 2017. However, the story changed significantly in 2018 as the number of deaths dropped from 7,306 deaths to 6,999 deaths, the lowest number of deaths that ever occurred in the rural settlement between 2009 and 2018.</p>
										<h2 data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">How many people died or survived a particular illness?</h2>
										<p data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">Ebola caused the highest number of death compared to the number of people that survived it. Ebola was the deadliest disease, without a doubt. However, the least incurable illness was Malaria. Malaria had the highest survival rate compared to how many people died from it.</p>
										<p data-aos="slide-up"
										data-aos-duration="900"
										data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">In summary, Malaria still kills, especially in the North. Awareness should be carried out. Do not underestimate malaria, cure it as soon as possible to avoid being a victim of malaria. Diarrhea however is the deadliest illness of all. As soon as your system stops functioning well, visit the clinic, and get tested. Your health is the most important thing. Thanks.</p>
